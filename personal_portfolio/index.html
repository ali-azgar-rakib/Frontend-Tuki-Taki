                    <p>People often say that nothing is impossible. I'm the kind of person who tends to take it easy and
                        not
                        do much every day!
                        However, I have a talent for mimicking quotes without explicitly mentioning the source. In terms
                        of
                        my professional
                        background, I work as a Web Developer and have expertise in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript,
                        Vue.js, PHP, Laravel, and
                        MySQL. If these technologies are unfamiliar to you, don't worry about it. Just know that I
                        consider
                        myself pretty
                        knowledgeable! üòê
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Currently, I hold a Junior Developer position at Paramorsho. I really enjoy using technology in
                        creative ways, which is
                        why I joined Paramorsho right from the start.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        During my time in college, I actively participated in social work. I joined a programming club
                        and
                        worked as a trainer.
                        Additionally, I was part of a movement called the 'Boipora Movement' (a Revolution for Reading
                        Books). We created a
                        library and cultural organization and organized reading sessions in 20 college universities. We
                        also
                        arranged an annual
                        science festival, cinema festival, and various other cultural events. I'm also a member of
                        creative
                        platforms like
                        Bishwo Shahitto Kendro and Bandhushava.

                        I have a deep love for reading books and watching movies. One of my favorite authors is Manik
                        Bandopadhyay. The ideas of
                        Yuval Noah Harari strongly influence me. When it comes to movies, my favorite director is Kim Ki
                        Duk
                        (but please be
                        aware that his movies are intended for mature audiences, so I wouldn't recommend them if you're
                        not
                        an adult or not
                        mature enough! üòå). I write reviews for movies and books, occasionally dabble in short story and
                        essay writing, and even
                        create some lighthearted comedy and memes.</p>
